# 0-Sense-Passwords
Got tired of looking around my room to create new passwords

I may need to introduce threading to speed up the execution for this, since sometimes it takes over 30seconds just to do 4 word long passwords.
    Introduced threading into the program speed up the program by quite a bit.
    
Look into unit testing, to figure out why it locks up when all the threads try accessing the same memeory and nonetype occurances.
